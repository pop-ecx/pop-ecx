## Hi there 👋
I've been postponing writing a profile readme...until now, so here it goes:

- My name is Oliver Mulwa
- I'm a cybersecurity guy (malware analysis) and a developer (at least on the side)
- I use Arch (btw) and on Occasion Parrot OS (not a fan of dragons)
- I believe if God was a coder, he'd use Neovim.
- 😄 Falling in love with Zig more everyday (please don't tell my girlfriend 😹)
- ⚡ Fun fact: The Catalan for white and Caro-kann for black are full proof ♟️ (Don't take my word for it though, I'm a noob)
